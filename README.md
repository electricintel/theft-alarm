When you want to leave your laptop for a brief time, do:

1. Ensure the laptop is unmuted and plugged-in to power supply.

2. Run the script in a terminal.

3. Lock your screen before you leave!

4. Then when you get back, close the terminal that runs the script.

If anyone tries to remove your laptop from that location, when you are away,
a siren alarm starts off! 

Be careful, Be safe!
